# Introduction
Why would we want to learn C++ when easier langauges like Python that do all the work for us exist? It's close to the hardware, so it gives much more control over things like memory management and optimization. Python is great for scientific coding where we don't really care about performance, but for actual programs (simulations, airplanes navigation systems, etc.), we'll want something that can be highly optimized.

Because it allows so much optimization, it's a very popular language that is in high demand. Anyone can pick up a lanugauge like Python in a few weeks. However, many won't put in the effort to learn C++. 

Learning it will teach you what is really happening under the hood in programming languages. But you're not here to find out why you should learn it; you're here to actually learn it. Let's get started.\
